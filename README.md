# Lottery Purchase System

This was my final project for my software engineering course at Texas Tech University. I built it with one other colleauge.

 The goal was to have a hypothetically functional Lottery Purchase system. Wher users could:
 * Purchase Lottery Tickets with Paypal or Credit Card
 * Save the user's credentials in a user profile (we did this in local storage)
 * Admin functionality like edit tickets, sales report, & create draw dates
 * User's should also be able to deposit their winnings into their bank account (up to a certain amount)
